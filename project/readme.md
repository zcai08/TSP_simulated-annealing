change the input folder address in SA.py line 64, where d = "your folder address"
input format: txt file, stores the matrix of distances seperated by space
in TestfileGenerate.py, I generate my test file with n_m.txt, where n is the scale of nodes and m is the number of different instance.
I use this format to generate plots, if the input file format is not so, the plots will return a line with slope equals to 0.
txt file with N = 10000 cannot be opened in my code, I cannot figure out the reason right now. Those test files are too large to upload through bb
